leikregl=The object of the game is to collect as many points as possible. That is done by throwing 5 dice and trying to get specific combinations. In each turn each player gets to throw the dice up to 3 times. The player can choose to only throw a certain amount of the dice after he has thrown them once. He can then push free dice to free the dice. In the first 6 lines the player is supposed to collect a certain sort of dice. The dices of that sort are then added up and the player gets as many points as the value of dice. If the total of these six rows is above 63 the player gets a bonus of 35 points. In three and four of a kind the player gathers three or four of a kind dice. The points are the total of the dice on the table, not just the three/four of a kind. In full house the player needs a pair and three of a kind. This gives him 25 points. Small straight is a row of 4 which awards the player 30 points and a large straight is a row of 5 which awards the player 40 points. Chance is sort of a trashcan where the number of points is the total value of the dice on the table. Finally, yahtzee is 5 of a kind and awards the player 50 points. Good luck!

Grunnur=Yahtzee is a game where you try to gather as many points as you can by throwing dice. When a player throws the dice red numbers appear in the point window which indicate the amount of points you would gather for each row from your current dice. The players throw the dice in turns until they have filled out the paper. If you don\u2018t know the rules of the game you can find them in the menu bar under "Help". If you want to see this information again you can also find them under "Help". Have fun!
